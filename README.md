## 04.04.2019 

Solving task was pausing time, 
I can't give enough time for solving tasks.  
because I was working in 2 work it was very difficult I 
continue solving tasks very detailed.

## 21.11.2019 
I changed work that's I cannot solve task in takes some time.
Decided to solve everyday minimum 5 tasks 
from 21.11.2019  to 21.12.2019 150 should be done and and finish 
algorithm course in every weekends
